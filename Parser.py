# Parser -- the parser for the Scheme printer and interpreter

#   class Parser
#
# Parses the language

#   exp  ->  ( rest
#         |  #f
#         |  #t
#         |  ' exp
#         |  integer_constant
#         |  string_constant
#         |  identifier
#    rest -> )
#         |  exp+ [. exp] )
#
# and builds a parse tree.  Lists of the form (rest) are further
# `parsed' into regular lists and special forms in the constructor
# for the parse tree node class Cons.  See Cons.parseList() for
# more information.
#
# The parser is implemented as an LL(0) recursive descent parser.
# I.e., parseExp() expects that the first token of an exp has not
# been read yet.  If parseRest() reads the first token of an exp
# before calling parseExp(), that token must be put back so that
# it can be re-read by parseExp() or an alternative version of
# parseExp() must be called.
#
# If EOF is reached (i.e., if the scanner returns None instead of a token),
# the parser returns None instead of a tree.  In case of a parse error, the
# parser discards the offending token (which probably was a DOT
# or an RPAREN) and attempts to continue parsing with the next token.
